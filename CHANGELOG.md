**With the following features:**
* Select country/city and reference year
* Create used accounts to specify profile type, save and track data
* **Proper presentation of the tool**
* A welcome page, with description of the tool, its goals and its relation to MYC
* Compute GHG emissions (using the ASIF methodology) with the following parameters:
    * Vehicules-kilometers travelled (vkt)
    * Occupancy and average trip length per vehicle type
    * Vkt per fuel type
    * Average energy consumption and energy efficiency
    * CO2 impact of electricity
* Improve the way data is filled
    * Progress bar to track data collection journey
    * Help in the choice of category of transport
    * Guide users in their inputs
    * Add a contact email or a way of reaching the MYC team
* Predict emissions increase based on economic and travel growth between now and 2050 if nothing is done (Business As Usual)
* **Visualize output data as graphs**
* Ease the understanding of computations

## 2.0
In 2023, the **version MVP2 was released**, complementing the scope to match the functionalities of the excel spreadsheet. The following features were included:
* Complete rework of the Inventory & BAU steps described in the first MVP. A project is now divided in three steps
    1. An inventory, focused only on the reference year. This is where vehicles and fuels are defined
    2. A Business as Usual (BAU) scenario, built on top of the inventory 
    3. One or more Climate scenarios, to be compared to the BAU
    * Each step includes a small results page, to identify potential problems in data
* Full rework of the User Interface
* **Match the features of the latest version of the offline tool (excel)**
    * This includes an update on computation methods, filling option, new types of fuels such as hydrogen and an update of default emission factors
* Creation of an **educational path** based on the MYC guides and notes from the Excel tool, including:
    * Explanatory and illustrated texts of various calculation methods
    * Description of the required data for each step
    * Detailed tooltips for each parameter
    * Concise formulas for intermediate calculations
    * Guidance on how data can be filled
* Addition of a source entry and management system for each data point
* Addition of a **note-taking field** on each page, providing a space to summarize assumptions and back-of-the-envelope calculations
* Unlike MVP1, the tool now supports the input of **climate scenarios**, with or without prior calculations
* Addition of a page for **comparing different scenarios**
    * This page contains a set of configurable graphs, exportable as PNG images or CSV files
    * It also includes a summary of the sources used in the project
    * Finally, it allows for downloading all data entered into the tool in CSV format. This export facilitates the transition from the online tool to Excel if necessary
* Similar to MVP1, a project can be "validated", making it visible to other users
* Unlike MVP1, population and GDP data have been removed since they are not used in emissions calculations

## 2.1 - Community Edition
2023 also includes the release of the **version 2.1 - Community Edition**, built with **volunteer work** from various contributors
* Redesign of the tool's introduction page, now more visually appealing
* Addition of new illustrations, icons, and a typeface in line with the MYC graphic design
* Significant work has been done to standardize all interface pages, accompanied by various visual enhancements 
    * For example, uniform cell sizes in tables and improved handling of text and number overflows have been implemented
* These improvements affect all visible pages, as well as dynamic elements like tooltips and popups
* In addition to numerous interface changes, a few bugs have been fixed:
    * Added support for HTTPS for a more secure browsing experience
    * Fixed a bug that prevented project creation under certain conditions
    * Corrected an incorrect vkt calculation based on the order of inventory filling in "fleet" mode
    * Fixed project deletion

## 2.2
* Branding
    * Made MYC name & logo more visible
    * Colorize partner logos
* UI
    * Fix text being cut short on required information fields on introduction pages
    * Fix invisible scrollbar on chrome (at least on unix)
    * Fix scrolling when choosing between default vehicle categories in inventory
* UX
    * Display well to wheel results by default on inventory results page
    * Prevent users from adding special characters and letters in number fields, also convert commas to dot automatically.
